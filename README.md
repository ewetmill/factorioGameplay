README driven development of factorio scenarios.

## Scenario 1
In this scenario, the goal is to create a pseudo keyboard in-game.
* anything can be used like switches or the circuit network.
* players "trip" a key in any way the designer desires

When a key is tripped, the letter will be represented on a pseudo screen.
* The screen can be simulated using lights or anything that allows letters/numbers to be distinguishable.
* Here are the options for displaying the characters:
   1. The letter is displayed until another is selected
   2. The letters are selected until an equivalent "Enter" button is selected.  At this point, the "sentence is displayed in a scrolling manner.
   3. letters are displayed sequentially until a wrapping occurs and the oldest letters are overwritten.
   
## Scenario 2
Mod factorio to extend Scenario 1 to accept keyboard input

## Scenario 3
Mod factorio to extend Scenario 2 to output the input characters to the screen/console

## Scenario 4
Create an instruction using input to sound an alarm
